## Problem Statement :
To develop a platform that enables farmers to interact 
directly with new mill owners, thereby eliminating 
intermediaries like village small business operators, 
Agricultural Produce and Livestock Market Committees 
(APMCs), and existing mill owners who often manipulate 
prices to their advantage. This platform aims to ensure 
that farmers receive fair compensation for their 
produce, reduce unnecessary costs, and foster a more 
transparent and equitable agricultural market.

##Solution :
Farmers connect directly with smaller mill owners, who supply products to business owners, ensuring fair prices for farmers while supporting the growth of new mill owners. This model benefits both farmers and emerging mill businesses. Farmers can list their crops on the website, detailing due dates and relevant information. Mill owners are notified, arrange transportation, and process the crops. Business owners also register on the platform, sourcing their products exclusively from these mills. To combat crop spoilage, which is common in India, the platform includes cold storage facilities, extending crop shelf life and improving overall supply chain efficiency.
