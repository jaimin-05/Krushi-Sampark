## Problem Statement :
To develop a platform that enables farmers to interact 
directly with new mill owners, thereby eliminating 
intermediaries like village small business operators, 
Agricultural Produce and Livestock Market Committees 
(APMCs), and existing mill owners who often manipulate 
prices to their advantage. This platform aims to ensure 
that farmers receive fair compensation for their 
produce, reduce unnecessary costs, and foster a more 
transparent and equitable agricultural market.
